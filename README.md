# FragmentToFragment-DataPass
 In the context of programming, especially in mobile app development or other software applications, passing data from one fragment to another is a common requirement. Fragments are components of an activity in Android, for example, and sometimes you need to send information from one fragment to another.

Here's a brief overview of how you can pass data from one fragment to another in Android using bundles:




### Sending Data from Fragment A to Fragment B:
```bash
// In Fragment A
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putString("key", "value"); // You can put any type of data in the bundle

FragmentB fragmentB = new FragmentB();
fragmentB.setArguments(bundle);

getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
    .replace(R.id.fragment_container, fragmentB)
    .addToBackStack(null)
    .commit();

```





### Receiving Data in Fragment B:
```bash
// In Fragment B
Bundle bundle = getArguments();
if (bundle != null) {
    String value = bundle.getString("key");
    // Do something with the received data
}

```





Remember to replace R.id.fragment_container with the actual ID of the container where your fragments are being displayed.
